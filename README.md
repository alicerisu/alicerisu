- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Amelia, I'm a webdev trying to learn and grow in the industry, I work as back-end but worked as fullstack for a time and I use this github to put some study material/projects I doing. There's a lot of things I do just to recap how to use some techs and tutorials for new ones. I also do gamedev as a hobbie and plan to start some personal projects both as gamedev and webdev.
